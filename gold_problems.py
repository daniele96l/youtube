Performance & Risk Claims

Gold is riskier than many think - volatility over 17%, higher than the S&P 500
Gold can disappoint during crises - prone to short-term sell-offs during market crashes, just like stocks
Gold can underperform for decades - took 30 years to recover from early 1980s peak to 2007

Portfolio Allocation Recommendations

Optimal allocation is 5-15% of portfolio based on Robeco study (1975-2022)
Above 20% allocation leads to higher risk and lower returns
Under 5% won't provide enough risk reduction benefits

Gold as Investment/Hedge Claims

Gold is NOT a good inflation hedge - contrary to popular belief
Inflation needs to be above 4% and sticky for gold to work as an inflation hedge
Gold lost 54% of value during 1980s-1990s when inflation was 2-4% but prices rose 115%
Gold provided great hedge in 1970s - increased sixfold during high inflation period

Current Market Drivers (2025)

USD weakness - gold outperforms when dollar is weak
Geopolitical tensions - Ukraine, Middle East conflicts support gold prices
Central bank buying - emerging countries diversifying away from US dollar
Real yields relationship broken - traditional correlation with Treasury yields disrupted since 2022
